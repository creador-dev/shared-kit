A reusable React and TypeScript toolkit for building consistent application and WordPress plugin interfaces. It combines locally owned shadcn/ui components, hooks, utilities, and opt-in styles in focused packages that can be installed separately or through one umbrella package.

## Highlights

- Locally owned shadcn/ui source that can be reviewed and updated deliberately.
- Direct, tree-shakable entry points for components, hooks, and utilities.
- Package-owned CSS variables use the `--wpxdev-*` namespace.
- Global styles and the `.wpxdev-root` reset remain opt-in.
- Custom compositions live separately from registry-managed UI components.
- Automated Changesets releases with npm Trusted Publishing and provenance.

| Package | Purpose | Documentation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`@wpxdev/shared-kit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wpxdev/shared-kit) | Umbrella entry point for the complete toolkit | [Package README](./packages/shared-kit/README.md) |
| [`@wpxdev/components`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wpxdev/components) | Accessible React components built from locally owned shadcn/ui source | [Package README](./packages/components/README.md) |
| [`@wpxdev/hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wpxdev/hooks) | Reusable React hooks | [Package README](./packages/hooks/README.md) |
| [`@wpxdev/styles`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wpxdev/styles) | CSS variables, scoped reset, utilities, and SCSS source | [Package README](./packages/styles/README.md) |
| [`@wpxdev/utils`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wpxdev/utils) | Dependency-free TypeScript utilities | [Package README](./packages/utils/README.md) |

## Quick start

Install the complete toolkit with its React peer dependencies:

```bash
pnpm add @wpxdev/shared-kit react react-dom
```

Import only the APIs and styles your application needs:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@wpxdev/shared-kit/components/button";
import { useMediaQuery } from "@wpxdev/shared-kit/hooks/use-media-query";
import { clamp } from "@wpxdev/shared-kit/utils/clamp";
import "@wpxdev/shared-kit/styles.css";

export function Toolbar() {
  const compact = useMediaQuery("(max-width: 48rem)");
  const visibleItems = clamp(compact ? 2 : 5, 1, 5);

  return <Button>Show {visibleItems} items</Button>;
}
```

Applications that need only part of the toolkit can install a focused package instead:

```bash
pnpm add @wpxdev/components react react-dom
```

```tsx
import { Button } from "@wpxdev/components/button";
import "@wpxdev/components/styles.css";
```

## Imports

Every package supports a root entry point, while commonly used APIs also have focused entry points:

```tsx
import { Button, Dialog } from "@wpxdev/components";
import { Button as FocusedButton } from "@wpxdev/components/button";
import { useDebouncedValue } from "@wpxdev/hooks/use-debounced-value";
import { cn } from "@wpxdev/utils/cn";
```

Focused imports make dependencies explicit and help consumers include only what they use.

## Styling and isolation

Component styles are opt-in and should be imported once at the application entry point:

```css
@import "@wpxdev/components/styles.css";
```

The standalone styles package supports compiled CSS, individual layers, and authored SCSS:

```css
@import "@wpxdev/styles/tokens.css";
@import "@wpxdev/styles/reset.css";
```

```scss
@use "@wpxdev/styles/index.scss";
```

Package-owned custom properties use names such as `--wpxdev-color-primary`. Wrap plugin interfaces in `.wpxdev-root` when applying the scoped reset so host WordPress admin styles are not changed globally.

## Components and customization

Registry-managed shadcn/ui components live in [`packages/components/src/components/ui`](./packages/components/src/components/ui). Keep product-specific variants, wrappers, and multi-component patterns in [`packages/components/src/components/composed`](./packages/components/src/components/composed) so future shadcn updates do not overwrite custom work.

The intended workflow is:

1. Update or add the base shadcn component under `components/ui`.
2. Preserve its standard public API and focused package export.
3. Add project-specific behavior under `components/composed`.
4. Import composed components explicitly where an application needs them.

## Development

This repository uses pnpm workspaces. Install dependencies and run the complete validation suite from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
```

During local development, workspace consumers can depend on packages without publishing them:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@wpxdev/components": "workspace:*",
    "@wpxdev/utils": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

## Adding a package

1. Copy the structure of the closest existing package under `packages/`.
2. Use an `@wpxdev/*` package name and define explicit `exports`.
3. Add repository metadata pointing to `wpxdevlabs/shared-kit` and the package directory.
4. Include source code, tests where applicable, and a package-level README.
5. Run the full validation suite and add a Changeset for publishable work.

## Releases

Every pull request that changes a published package must describe its release impact:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Use `pnpm changeset --empty` only for package-file changes that intentionally require no version bump. After changes reach `main`:

1. Changesets creates or updates the `chore: version packages` pull request.
2. Merging that pull request publishes each changed package to npm.
3. npm Trusted Publishing signs provenance through GitHub Actions OIDC.
4. GitHub receives one consolidated release containing every package published in that batch.

Package versions remain independent, and package-specific Git tags provide exact source traceability.
